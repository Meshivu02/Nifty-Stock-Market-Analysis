# Nifty Stock Market Analysis with Regression

## Overview

This Python project extends the basic Nifty 50 stock market analysis by incorporating a linear regression algorithm to predict future stock prices based on historical data. It fetches historical stock data, calculates daily returns, and visualizes key aspects such as closing prices, daily returns, cumulative returns, and includes a linear regression model for price prediction.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed before running the project:

- Python 3.x
- `yfinance` library
- `pandas` library
- `matplotlib` library
- `scikit-learn` library

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nifty-stock-analysis.git
cd nifty-stock-analysis

## Run the Python script:
python manage.py


## Usage
After running the script, in addition to the visualizations, the script will now train a linear regression model to predict closing prices.
The model's performance metrics and a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted closing prices will be displayed.


## Dependencies
yfinance: Fetching historical stock data.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: Data visualization.
scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and tools
